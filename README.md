# DMU-ABSE

DMU-ABSE is a multi-user searchable encryption scheme, which data owners authorizes data users in a a fine-grained manner by specifying access policy in the keyword index ciphertext.
Meanwhile, DMU-ABSE achieves hidden-policy, constant size and non-deterministic.
With the collaboration of the proxy server, the keyword indexes and search trapdoors will be re-encrypted before sending to the cloud server so that the cloud server can merge them into one index matrix and search over encrypted data without learning any information.
Furthermore, DMU-ABSE supports dynamic archives and user revocation, which is more practical in the scenario of PHR and online subscription systems.
